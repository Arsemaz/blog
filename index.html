          Course </b></div>
      <div class="col-9">
        <p>Hello! My name is Arsema and i have started studing with the <a href="https://www.refactory.ug"> Refactory
          </a> at the
          biginnig of May.
          My main reason for begining this course is that i want to change career path.
          I realized before i began the classes that it could be challenging but i said to my self
          I can start now and see where it leads me. If it leads me to a new career good, if not
          at least I tryed and knowledge is power so i will gain that.
          So no matter what, I will not waste my time and money. <br><br>
          My first month of the course was good and overwhelming at the same time.

          I know what you are thinking "overwhelming", but with work and family it has been hard.
          I never work and study before so it was all new to me,
          at the same time at work there could be any urgent things to do. So I have to priortise it.
          But it is always good to challenge your self, for the sake of your future.
          <br><br>
          The classes were very good and enjoyable.<span id="dots">....</span><span id="more">
            Our teacher let us interact and ask quetions so that was
            helpful, they also provide all the necessary links or websites.
            The first course was about html, css, version control and git and so on.
            I attended most of the classes but i usually did't find time to do perosnal research on the lessons.
            <br> The lessons are not hard they look simple and practical, the problem starts when I
            use them together to build a specific page.
            So the personal research and practice becomes handy because no matter how many times we learn
            it will not be useful unless we practice.
        </p>
        </span>

      
      
        <h2 style="font-size:xx-large; font-style:bold; text-align: center;"> Work and Study</h2>
        <p>s my first time studying while working, and it has been years since i finish school.
          So it has been difficult. But with the right attitude and strategy I am able to do it. <br>
          The first thing i did was create a plan, like most of the time or my priority is my
          job and at the same time i need to make time for studying . so the best thing to do is minimize
          leisure time. It is not fun but it's worth it.
          The secound thing I did was let my employer know, not only that I am studying but also that
          I am capable to do both and to be available at all times.
          

            When you sit or stay indoors all day, it can be bad for your health.
            So its good to exercise or take a walk.
            I also a good music, it can help me relax.
            Taking a break once in a while is also good, even if I have alots of things to do
            I like to take a break and relax, and whne you return to your work or classes
            you will have a fresh mind .
            Always knowing your limits is also good. For instance I recently had very busy schedule at work
            and I skip meals and slept late. And the next days I was very week and I went to the hospital.
            Gladly I was ok , but sometimes its good to know and plan the things you can do and you leave the things you
            can"t.

        <h3 style="font-size:xx-large; font-style:bold; text-align: center;"> My Class Experience</h3>
        <p> The first course was for a month or so, and it included Introduction to Software, Introduction to
          Vision Control git and github, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
          Our lecturer was Samson, and it was intersting, and it was easy and practical when we were learning.
          The problem for me was when I use all the codes together.
          After few weeks starting the course we were assigned couches. They were very helpful.
          And When ever i am struggling I can easily contact them and ask for help.
          <br>
          The first lesson was mainly about the Introduction of Software and how the internet works.
          It was so intersting because of the progress it has, and it was all done with in short period of time.
          The second lesson was about the source-code editer that we need to use for programing, which is Visual Studio
          Code.
          I was very suprised how user friendly the editer was. I was expecting complicated one.
          After words we stared HTML, the lesson was clear and we had a lot of useful links that
          we can refer anytime like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">w3schools</a> and so many
          other
          links as well.
          HTML was not hard but the way I see it, you have to give it time and practice.
          CSS is a language used to style HTML, it describes how HTML element displays.
          <br>
          Git and github was also inroduced on our course, this part of the lesson was hard
          for me because sometimes I miss classes. The classes were recorded but the problem was
          I could't have time to watch the video. And the second day classes are not clear because you missed a class.
          Other than that the teacher was good and provide enugh information.
          We also learned Bootstrap, which was very useful for me and for all bigginers in programing.
          <br>
          Now this is my secound month of Joining Refactory and I am enjoying it, the teachers are very good and
          supportive.
          I am glad I joined.
